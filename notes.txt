Items
	tier 0 obstacles (50% no obstacle, 50% prior tier 0)
	tier 1 obstacles (60% tier 0 obstacle, 40% prior tier 1)
	tier 2 obstacles (60% tier 1 obstacle, 40% prior tier 2)
Obstacles
	
Bosses
	tier 0 requires last tier 0 item
	tier 1 requires last tier 1 item
	tier 2 requires last tier 2 item
	tier 3 requires other 3 bosses defeated
Transport
	requires all tier 0 items from the area
Upgrades
	random obstacles (50% tier 0, 30% tier 1, 20% tier 2)

This doesn't work because placing an obstacle needs to know
what item is required.
need a sequence
need a pool of sectors (items, obstacles, cross-roads, generic)
	pull from the pool, into the sequence
	
the start gets added to the pool
start
	generic is added to the pool

generic
	another generic or cross-road is added to the pool
	
cross-road
	choose [2, 3] one generic, the rest obstacles.
	
obstacle
	choose [1, 2] generic
